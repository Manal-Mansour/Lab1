    <p title="I'm a tooltip"><b>Mouse over this paragraph,What I find remarkable is that this text has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it
            to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even
            the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in.
            It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the
            phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors published his letter in a
            correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”).

        “On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
        by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
        that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
        is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to
        do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
        owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
        repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
        selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
        pains.”
